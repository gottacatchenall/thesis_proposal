Requirements


> Candidates  must  submit  a  thesis  proposal  at  least  7  days  prior  to
> the  examination.  It  is  the  student’s responsibility to provide each
> member of the Examining Committee with a copy, as well as Ancil Gittens in the
> graduate office. The thesis proposal should address the relevant background,
> the specific questions to be asked and their significance, the approach and
> methods, results already obtained, and the anticipated schedule. The proposal
> should be no more than 10 double-spaced pages (12 font). This limit does  not
> include  tables,  figures,  figure  legends,  bibliography  or  the  planned
> timeline  to  complete  work. Committee  members  will  not  be  responsible
> for  reviewing  text  in  excess  of  the  page  limit.  The  written proposal
> may include  preliminary results if available but must address the whole scope
> (all chapters) of the projected thesis.   The  proposal  serves  two
> purposes.  First,  it  defines  the  research  area  and  thus  forms  a
> basis  for questioning.    Second,  it  is  itself  part  of  the  evidence
> upon  which  a  final  evaluation  will  be  made.  For these  reasons,  it
> should  be  written  with  care.  Please  see  the  additional  tips  on
> proposal  writing  in  the document titled “QE Expectations and Advice”

> The  student  must  provide  a  written  proposal  for  their  project  to
their  QE  examining committee at least 7 days prior to the scheduled QE. An
acceptable proposal must be provided at least 7 days in advance or the QE may
need to be rescheduled. It is strongly recommended that a draft of the  proposal
be  provided  to  the  supervisory  committee  at  least  a  few  days  prior
to  the  supervisory committee  meeting  mentioned  above.  This  allows  for
maximal  feedback  to  be  incorporated  prior  to the QE. The  proposal  should
be  similar  in  nature  to  an  NSERC  grant  application  describing  the
research approach.  In  general  in  your  proposal  and  in  all  future
scientific  writing,  using  subheadings  and  clear writing to help the reader
is a good idea. The guidelines mandate a proposal of 2500 words (approximately
10  pages  double  spaced).  This  limit  does  not  include  tables,  figures,
bibliography,  figure  legends,  or  a planned timeline to complete work. This
2500 word limit will be enforced. A  proposal  of  12  pages  might not  be
rejected  (or  it  might),  but  a  proposal  of  15  pages  definitely  will.
Similarly,  the  presentation  at  the start of the QE is required to be 1520
minutes. This will also be enforced. Both the written proposal and the oral
presentation  may  include  preliminary  results  if  available  but  must
address  the  whole  of  the  projected thesis.
> - A successful QE will depend heavily on a top-quality proposal. This proposal
  should go through multiple drafts and be honed to a very finely worded
  document that shows the clarity of your thinking through conciseness and exact
  statements. Some topics you should probably cover are listed below. We
  recommend discussing omissions from this list with your advisor and your
  supervisory committee if you think some of these sections are not relevant to
  your particular project.
> - Brief review of the current state of knowledge
> - Precise statement of the question and/or hypotheses
> - Description of the methods
> - Detailed description of the experimental or sample design. Be clear about what
  factors are being controlled or sampled. Provide specific numbers for how many
  levels of each factor are planned, and how many replicates/samples within each
  factor. Address any issues that arise from finite effort levels in terms of
  tradeoffs between replication within vs. between factors (i.e. describe why
  your plan is optimal). Provide a realistic estimate of the amount of time this
  will require in the lab or field.
> - Statistical analysis approach. Describe specific statistical approaches, the
  output of these approaches, how these can be used to test your hypotheses,
  assumptions of the tests, and potential problems.
> - If you will be using novel measurement techniques, provide a detailed
  description (if you are using standard techniques then references to the
  standard techniques are enough).
> - Provide a description of each chapter anticipated in the dissertation (this
> - may be incorporated into the above sections or as a separate section).
> - A brief statement of the broader importance of the question to your field and to society
> - Provide a timeline showing when the research and writing will be performed
