Within the last several hundred years, human activity has rapidly
reshaped Earth's surface. These changes can roughly be divided into two
categories: (1) Land-use change, where Earth's surface changes and (2)
climate change, words here, as a result of greenhouse gas emissions.

As a result \emph{ecological forecasting}, or building models to
estimate how ecological systems will change over time, has as an
imperative to mitigate the effect of these changes on Earth's
ecosystems, their functioning, and the services they provide to humans
(\textbf{dietze?}).

An oft applied definition of the origin of is ``the application of the
scientific method to natural history.'' Since its origin ecology has
been a descriptive science. This is a natural by-product of the immense
variability of Earth's biosphere. emerged to explain particular
phenomena at particular scales.

In recent years, there has been an interest in an epistemological shift
in ecology. To shift ecology into a predictive science. The
justification for this shift is twofold: (1) bogged down philosophy of
science, by further rooting our understanding of ecosystem function and
dynamics in an ability to predict their structure
(\textbf{PredictiveEcology?}). and (2) the practical need for models for
\emph{ecological forecasting}.

Historically the term ``theory,'' as applied in the physical sciences,
refers to mathematical models, typically an equation describing how the
value of an observable state of the system, represented by a vector of
numbers \([x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]^T = \vec{x}\) changes as over time.

\(\vec{x}(t)\) but instead to define how the state of \(\vec{x}\)
changes from one time to the next.

Because of its early success in the physical science, the led to
framework for bridging theory and data.

A large set of problems in ecology when aiming to confront
high-dimensional analytic models with data:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Often assume long-run equilibrium.
\end{itemize}

Ecological processes vary across more variables than the tools of
analytic models are suited for.

As the number of variables in an analytic model increases, so does the
ability of the scientist to decern clear relationships between them, and
so does overfitting potential.

Curse of dimensionality--- Until the 20th century, no theory of the
gravitational dynamics of more than 2 bodies. Understanding the
gravitational dynamics of more than two planets with any reliability
proved difficult. Using the same models (diffeqs), how could we
adequately predict ecosystems?

Chaotic dynamics emerge from simple analytic models, and . Whether
ecosystems actually exhibit chaotic behavior is a different question.

The term \emph{ecological forecasting} implicitly creates an analogy
between predicting how ecosystems will change in the future and weather
forecasting. Use of computational methods in NWP. Much as one would not
aim to forecast the weather in Quebec by applying Navier-Stokes. NWP has
worked because it incorporates information about data and meteorological
processes collected at difference scales into models that.

Transition to simulation as the solution: shift toward approach of
building models that \emph{generate} data.

(resolving the semantic ambuity of what differentiates ``mechanistic''
vs ``phenomological'' models is out of scope for now). ----

Transition to theme of optimization given unknown information. A
forecast gives us a range of future values with uncertainty around them.
Further a convenient property that a forecasting model's uncertainty
goes up over time (if we assume the underlying process is Markov--this
is a strong assumption but oft true of the models we fit to temporal
data)

In face of uncertainty, decision making is an optimization problem. We
have some goal state for the future, and some estimate of what the state
of the world will be given a set of actions. Frame optimization problem
mathematically an introduce concept of solution-space and constraint.

Indeed Marx's most well known quote that ``philosophers have hitherto
only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.''

and a necessary step toward establishing a just and sustainable world.

\section{CH1 Forecasting the spatial and phenological uncoupling of a
plant-pollinator
network}\label{ch1-forecasting-the-spatial-and-phenological-uncoupling-of-a-plant-pollinator-network}}

This chapter uses several years of data on bee-flower phenology and
interactions, combined with spatial records of species occurrence via
GBIF, to predict the probability of each realized interaction network as
a function of location and time.

Two ways in which this network of interactions can become uncoupled:
spatial and temporal. Overlap in ranges and shifts in ranges.
Elevational gradient as proxy for range shifts

of the estimated distribution of both species.

This chapter proposes an algorithm for optimizing
(corridorplacement/restoration effort) given a raster where each cell
indicates land-cover. The optimization method uses the result of a
simulated process (specifically occupancy dynamics in the landscape) and
uses simulated annealing to estimate the global optimum of the
targetstate (specfically mean-time-to-extinction for the occupancy
dynamics example).
