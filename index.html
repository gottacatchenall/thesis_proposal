            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
            <p>Within the last several hundred years, human activity has induced rapid changes in Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and surface. Greenhouse gas emissions have caused an increase the temperature of both Earth’s terrain and oceans, and both agricultural and urban development has rapidly reshaped the Earth’s land cover. These the bulk of this change has occurred within the last several hundred years, a geological instant, inducing a sudden shift in conditions to Earth’s climate and biosphere. As a result <em>ecological forecasting</em>—modeling how ecosystems and their services will change in the future—and then using these forecasts to make decisions to mitigate the negative consequences of this change on ecosystems, their functioning, and the services they provide to humans has emerged as an imperative for ecology and environmental science <span class="citation" data-cites="Dietze2017PreEco">(Dietze 2017)</span>. However, robust prediction of ecological processes is, to say the least, quite difficult <span class="citation" data-cites="Beckage2011LimPre Petchey2015EcoFor">(Beckage <em>et al.</em> 2011; Petchey <em>et al.</em> 2015)</span>. This difficultly is compounded by a few factors, the first being that sampling ecosystems is not easy. Ecological data is often biased, noisey, and sparse in both space and time. The current paucity of ecological data has resulted in much interest in developing global systems for <em>ecosystem monitoring</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Makiola2020KeyQue">(Makiola <em>et al.</em> 2020)</span>, which would systematize the collection of biodiversity data in manner that makes detecting and predicting change more possible than at the moment <span class="citation" data-cites="Urban2021CodLif">(Urban <em>et al.</em> 2021)</span>.</p>
            <p>The second major challenge in ecological forecasting is that the underlying dynamics of most ecological processes are unknown and instead must be inferred from this (sparse) data. Much of the history of quantitatively modeling ecosystems have been done in the language of dynamical systems, describing how the value of an observable state of the system, represented by a vector of numbers <span class="math inline">[<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>]<sup><em>T</em></sup> = <em>x⃗</em></span> changes as over time, yielding models in the form of differential equations in continuous-time settings, <span class="math inline">$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$</span>, or difference equations in discrete-time settings, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub>)</span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>f</em> : ℝ<sup><em>n</em></sup> → ℝ<sup><em>n</em></sup></span> is an arbitrary function describing how the system changes on a moment-to-moment basis (e.g. in the context of communities, <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> could be Lotka-Voltera, Holling-Type-III or DeAngelis-Beddington functional response). The form of this functional response in real systems, and whether it is meaningfully non-zero for a given species interaction, is effectively unknown, and some forms are inherently more “forecastable” than others <span class="citation" data-cites="Chen2019RevCom Pennekamp2019IntPre Beckage2011LimPre">(Beckage <em>et al.</em> 2011; Chen <em>et al.</em> 2019; Pennekamp <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span>. The initial success of these forms of models can be traced back to the larger program of ontological reductionism, which became the default approach to modeling in the sciences after its early success in physics, which, by the time ecology was becoming a quantitative science (sometime in the 20th century, depending on who you ask), became the foundation for mathematical models in ecology.</p>
            <p>However, we run into many problems when aiming to apply this type of model to empirical ecological data. Ecosystems are perhaps the quintessential example of system that cannot be understood by iterative reduction of its components into constituent parts—ecological phenomena are emergent: the product of different mechanisms operating a different spatial, temporal, and organizational scales <span class="citation" data-cites="Levin1992ProPat">(Levin 1992)</span>. Further this analytical approach to modeling explicitly ignores known realities: ecological dynamics not deterministic and many analytic models in ecology assume long-run equilibrium. Finally, perhaps the biggest challenge in using these models to describe ecological processes is ecosystems consist of more dimensions than the tools of analytic models are suited for. As the number of variables in an analytic model increases, so does the ability of the scientist to discern clear relationships between them given a fixed amount of data, the so-called “curse” of dimensionality.</p>
            <p>But these problems are not solely unique to ecology. The term <em>ecological forecasting</em> implicitly creates an analogy with weather forecasting. Although it has become a trite joke to complain about the weather forecast being wrong, over the least 50 years the field of numerical weather prediction (NWP) has dramatically improved out ability to predict weather across the board <span class="citation" data-cites="Bauer2015QuiRev">(Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015)</span>. The success of NWP, and the Earth observations systems that support it <span class="citation" data-cites="Hill2004ArcEar">(Hill <em>et al.</em> 2004)</span>, should serve as a template for development of a system for monitoring Earth’s biodiversity. Much like ecology, NWP is faced with high-dimensional systems that are governed by different mechanisms at different scales. The success of NWP is that, rather than, say, attempt to forecast the weather in Quebec by applying Navier-Stokes to entire province, to instead use simulation models which describe known mechanisms at different scales, and use the availability to increasing computational power to directly simulate many batches of dynamics which directly incorporate stochasticity and uncertainty in parameter estimates via random number generation.</p>
            <p>But forecasting is only half the story—if indeed “[ecologists] have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it,” then once we have a forecast about how an ecosystem will change in the future, what if this forecast predicts a critical ecosystem service will deteriorate? We are still left with the question, what do we in the time being to mitigate the potentially negative consequences a forecast predicts? In this framing, mitigating the consequences of anthropogenic change on ecosystems becomes an optimization problem: given a forecast of the future state of the system, and some “goal” state for the future, the problem is then to optimize our intervention into the system to maximize the probability the system approaches our “goal” state. This dissertation aims to this framework for ecosystem monitoring and forecasting (fig. 1, left), and each chapter address some aspect of this pipeline to data from a monitoring network to forecasts to mitigation strategy (fig. 1, right).</p>

            <p>The primary research challenges this thesis addresses: how do we design ecological samples to? How do we build the software infrastructure to assimilate data from a variety of sources? How do we propagate uncertainty from data to forecasts? The flow of chapters follows the flow in fig. 1 (left), from data collection via a monitoring network, to forecasting an essential biodiversity variable (EBV), to optimizing mitigation strategy based on constraints. In chapter one, we discuss how simulation can aid in the design of ecological samples and monitoring network design. In chapter two we use data to forecast the uncoupling of a plant-pollinator network. In chapter three, we apply simulation methods in landscape ecology to optimize corridor placement with respect maximize the time-until-extinction of a metapopulation. The fourth and final chapter is the software (<em>MetacommunityDynamics.jl</em>) which enables the rest of the dissertation.</p>
            <h1 id="chapter-one-optimizing-spatial-sampling-of-species-interactions">Chapter One: Optimizing spatial sampling of species interactions</h1>
            <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
            <p>This chapter uses simulation models to investigate the relationship between species relative abundance, sampling effort, and probability of observing an interaction between species in order to aid in the design of samples of ecological interactions, and to provide a null expectation of false-negative probability for a dataset of a given size. Further it then proposes a method for optimizing the spatial sampling locations to maximize the probability of detecting an interaction between two species given a fixed number of total of observations, and the distributions of each species. This addresses the optimization of monitoring network part of the flow from data to mitigation at the top of fig. 1, left. As explored in the previous chapter, there are false-negatives in interaction data. However, there is more than one way to observe a false-negative when sampling interactions. fig. 2 shows a taxonomy of false-negatives in occurrence, co-occurrence, and interaction data.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="./figures/ch2.png" id="fig:fnrtaxonomy" alt="Figure 2: A taxonomy of occurrence, co-occurrence, and interaction false negatives in data" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2: A taxonomy of occurrence, co-occurrence, and interaction false negatives in data</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
            <p>The first result is to compute a null expectation of the probability of an interaction false-negative as a function number of total observations of individuals of <em>any species</em>. This is done by simulating the process of observation, where the probability of observing a given species is its relative abundance. We use a log-normal distribution of relative abundance <span class="citation" data-cites="Hubbell2001UniNeu">(Hubbell 2001)</span> and simulating the process of observation on food-webs generated using the niche model <span class="citation" data-cites="Williams2000SimRul">(Williams &amp; Martinez 2000)</span> with connectance parameterized by the flexible-links model <span class="citation" data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">(MacDonald <em>et al.</em> 2020)</span>. An example of this relation for networks with varying spceies richness is shown in fig. 3.</p>
            <p>We then go on to testing some assumptions of this neutral model with empirical data. Primarily that we analytically show that our neutral model, if anything, underestimates the probability of false-negatives if there are positive associations between species co-occurrence, and we show these positive associations exist in two sets of spatially replicated samples of interaction networks <span class="citation" data-cites="Hadfield2014TalTwo Thompson2000ResSol">(Thompson &amp; Townsend 2000; Hadfield <em>et al.</em> 2014)</span>, fig. 4—further I’m planning to add the field data from the previous chapter into this analysis once available. Finally this chapter proposes a simulated annealing method to optimize the a set of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> points in space to maximize the probability of detecting an interaction between two species <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> with <em>known</em> distributions <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>a</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span>.</p>
            <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
            <p>The first major result is using the simulation of the observation process described above to generate expectations of interaction false-negative rate (FNR) as a function of total number of observations, with the goal being for this estimate to be used as correction for detection error when fitting an interaction prediction model. This relationship varies with the total richness of the metaweb fig. 3.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The second major result is that we analytically show that the this simulated observation model, by assuming that there is no association between observing two species given that they interact, actually under predicts the realized false-negative interaction rate. We then demonstrate that this positive association association exists in two empirical systems fig. 4.</p>

            <h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
            <p>This chapter is mostly complete. The only remaining work is the implementation of simulated annealing optimization process. This will be done by using a proposal function which takes a set of coordinates in space and proposes a new location for each point based on a distance-decaying kernel.</p>

            <h2 id="objective-1">Objective</h2>
            <p>Interactions between plants and pollinators form networks which together structure the “architecture of biodiversity” <span class="citation" data-cites="Bascompte2007PlaMut">(Bascompte &amp; Jordano 2007)</span>. The functioning and stability of ecosystems emerge from these interactions, but anthropogenic change threatens to unravel and “rewire” these interaction networks <span class="citation" data-cites="CaraDonna2017IntRew">(CaraDonna <em>et al.</em> 2017)</span>, jeopardizing the persistence of these systems. Plant-pollinator networks face two possible forms of rewiring in response to anthropogenic environmental change: spatial and temporal. Range shifts could cause interacting species to no longer overlap in space, and shifts in phenology could cause interacting species to no longer occur at the same time of year. This chapter uses several years of data on bumblebee-flower phenology and interactions across several field sites, each consisting of several plots across an elevational gradient, combined with spatial records of species occurrence via GBIF to forecast the uncoupling of the plant-pollinator metaweb of Colorado.</p>

            <h2 id="methods-1">Methods</h2>
            <p>The data for this chapter is derived from multiple sources that can be split into four categories. (1) Field data from three different field sites across Colorado, each with multiple plots across an elevational gradient, for seven, seven, and three years respectively. This data was collected by Paul CaraDonna and Jane Oglevie (from the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; RMBL) and Julian Resasco (CU Boulder). (2) GBIF spatial occurrence records of each of these species across Colorado, including a metaweb of interactions across all of Colorado taken from GBIF. (3) Remotely sensed data consisting of current and forecasting bioclimatic variables from CHELSA.

After validating and selecting the best performing model, we then predict how these distributions of each of these species will change under the CMIP6 consensus climate forecast <span class="citation" data-cites="Karger2017CliHig">(Karger <em>et al.</em> 2017)</span>, and then finally quantify the reduction in spatial between species for which there is a predicted interaction.</p>

            <p>Here we show the in-progress results, which are the prerequisites for the analysis outlined above: phylogenies for both plant and bee species (fig. <strong>¿fig:phylo?</strong>) and species distribution models for all species (an example shown in fig. <strong>¿fig:example_sdm?</strong>).</p>
            <h2 id="progress-1">Progress</h2>
            <p>At the moment, we have derived phylogenies (fig. <strong>¿fig:phylo?</strong>) and SDMs (fig. <strong>¿fig:example_sdm?</strong>) for all the species present in the Colorado GBIF metaweb. I’ve also been exploring the data available from Julian Resasco. The primary constraint on further progress is that we are waiting on the finalization of a data sharing agreement with RMBL.</p>

            <h2 id="objective-2">Objective</h2>
            <p>As land-use change has caused many habitats to become fragmented and patchy, promoting landscape connectivity has become of significant interest to mitigate the effects of this change on Earth’s biodiversity. However, the practical realities of conservation mean that there is a limitation on how much we can modify landscapes in order to do this. So what is the best place to put a corridor given a constraint on how much surface-area you can change in a landscape? This is the question this chapter seeks to answer. Models for inferring corridor locations have been developed, but are limited in that are not developed around promoting some element of ecosystem function, but instead by trying to find the path of least resistance in an existing landscape from a derived resistance surface <span class="citation" data-cites="Peterman2018ResRP">(Peterman 2018)</span>. This chapter proposes a general algorithm for choosing corridor placement to optimize a measurement of ecosystem functioning derived from simulations run on each proposed landscape modification.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>We propose various landscape modifications which alter the cover of a landscape, represented as a raster. We then compute a new resistance surface based on the proposed landscape modification using Circuitscape <span class="citation" data-cites="McRae2008UsiCir">(McRae <em>et al.</em> 2008)</span>, and based on the values of resistance to dispersal between pair of locations we simulate spatially-explicit metapopulation dynamics model <span class="citation" data-cites="Ovaskainen2002MetMod Hanski2000MetCap">(Hanski &amp; Ovaskainen 2000; Ovaskainen <em>et al.</em> 2002)</span> to estimate a distribution of time until extinction for each landscape modification. The largest challenge in implementing this algorithm is the space of potential modifications grows as <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>((<em>n</em><em>m</em>)!)</span> for an <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> by <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> raster. For most actual landscapes to which we wish to apply this method, the set of possible modifications becomes uncomputably large, so we use simulated annealing to explore the search space of possible modifications to estimate the modification that maximizes the time-until extinction of simulated metapopulation dynamics under that hypothetical modified landscape.</p>
            <p><strong>TK</strong> The biggest challenge in implementing simulated annealing in this context is defining a proposal function for landscape modifications. At the moment this is done by computing the minimum-spanning-tree (MST) of the spatial nodes, and then proposing corridors that connect nodes that are already connected in the MST.</p>
            <p><strong>TK</strong> The goal to rank the cells in the raster by priority based on how many times they are converted in the distribution of “good” corridors after simulated annealing has reached a pseudoequilibrium. Further, the final component of this chapter is measuring the effect of land-use change on the robustness of the optimized corridor. By simulating various neutral models of urban and agricultural sprawl, we can determine if the proposed modifications</p>
            <h2 id="progress-2">Progress</h2>
            <p>The current progress is that I have an algorithm for proposing landscape modifications and a simple implementation of simulated annealing. The only gap left is implementing Circuitscape estimation of resistance surfaces.</p>

            <h2 id="objective-3">Objective</h2>
            <p>The final chapter consists of a collection of modules in the Julia language for different aspects of community ecology, including most of the code used for the preceding chapters. Indeed <code>MetacommunityDynamics.jl</code> (MCD.jl) is the epicenter of this set of tools, but due to the nature of the Julia language, MCD.jl is interoperable with serveral existing packages within the <code>EcoJulia</code> organization, including several to which I have contributed. We need a software library like this to generate synthetic data from a <em>known</em> set of mechanisms and parameters to test our methods for parameter inference and forecasting on this <em>known</em> system to assess the effectiveness of these inference and forecasting methods.</p>

            <h2 id="methods-3">Methods</h2>
            <p>A diagram showing the relation between these packages is shown in fig. 6. <code>MetacommunityDynamics.jl</code> is built on <code>DynamicGrids.jl</code>, a library for high-performance gridded simulations in the <code>Julia</code> language, and Dispersal.jl <span class="citation" data-cites="Maino2021PreGlo">(Maino <em>et al.</em> 2021)</span>, and extension of <code>DynamicGrids.jl</code> specifically for modeling organism dispersal. It also contains integrations with <code>EcologicalNetworks.jl</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2019EcoJl">(Poisot <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span> to generate metawebs, or can use empirical networks from Mangal.jl <span class="citation" data-cites="Banville2021ManJl">(Banville <em>et al.</em> 2021)</span>. It implements the general framework for community dynamics proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Vellend2010ConSyn">Vellend (2010)</span>, where all community processes can divided into four categories: selection, dispersal, drift, and speciation.</p>

            <p>The software as it exists is capable of simulating the biomass dynamics of arbitrarily large food-webs using Lotka-Volterra, Holling Type-II, or Holling Type-III functional responses. It currently has methods to implement Gaussian drift, and verious forms of dispersal via Dispersal.jl. Also occupancy dynamics for Levins metapopulations <span class="citation" data-cites="Levins1969DemGen">(Levins 1969)</span>, and spatially explicit Hanski-Ovaskainen metapopulations <span class="citation" data-cites="Hanski2000MetCap Ovaskainen2002MetMod">(Hanski &amp; Ovaskainen 2000; Ovaskainen <em>et al.</em> 2002)</span>. This is most of what needs to exist for the preceding chapters. In-progress functionality includes selection (which affects growth-rate) on arbitrary environmental variables in progress, as well as traits.</p>
