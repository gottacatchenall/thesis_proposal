> Given that your project has a strong focus on methodologies, I would suggests reading more general texts on (meta)community ecology. Going over important theories of trophic regulation and community structrure in frangmented landscapes would be good. I would recommend Kevin McCann’s book (‘Food Webs’) in the princeton monographs series, and Michel Loreau’s book on communities and ecosystems in the same series. I could also see important connections with spatial statistics methodologies used in landscape ecology; something like Dale and Fortin’s ‘Quantitative Analysis of Ecological Networks’ (you might know this one already given your project. Use these references to make you can link your methods with underlying ecological concepts affecting spatial distribution and species assembly (competitive and trophic) in spatially-structured landscapes.
