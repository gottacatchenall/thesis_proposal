## CH1 - The Balance of Nature: What is it and why care?

- Much of this book is concerned with stability/persistence.
- Early on ecologists promoted diversity and stability and directly related
- **resilience**: Pimm et al (1991) argues rapid return to equilibrium after pertubation
- Ivas et al 2008: variation in environment and pop stability
- Tilman (1998) and Doak et al (1998): Variation in species populations (spatial/temporal) at local scales can beget llarger scale stability 
- Kevin McCann basically agrees with this
- Ives and Carpenter 2007: different definitions of stability often lead to different answers, but measures that involve _dynamics_ consistently give the same qualitative answer
 > For instance, attributes that are stable
in one sense (e.g., a population return forms a large perturbation rapidly) may be destabilizing
in some other important sense (e.g., the same rapidly returning population overshoots the
equilibrium and oscillates).


### Metrics of Stability 

#### Persistance-based metrics

Most of this book is about these metrics. 

| Measure          			| Definition      	| 
|----------------			|-------------------|
| Engineering Resilience   	| Stability increases with desceasing terun time to an attracting state after pertubation              	|             	               	                           	|
| Equilibrium Resilience  	| The state after pertubation is an equilibrium attractor. (inverse of max eigenvalue, $\frac{1}{\lambda_{max}}$              	|             	 					                           	|
| Nonequilibrium Resilience | The state after pertubation is a nonequilibrium attractor        	  		|             	               	                           	|
| Variance Stability		| Variation in density over time              	|             	               	                           	|
| Bounded/Minima Stability 	| Higher minimum state value across all dimensions is better             	|             	               	                       


#### Change-based metrics
| Measure          							| Definition      	| 
|----------------							|-------------------|
| Alternative-Stable-State Stability I   	| A system is deemed less stable the more alternative states it has.              	|             	               	                           	|
| Alternative-Stable-State Stability II  	| A measure of the amount of change or disruption (i.e., the size of the perturbation) that is required to transform a system from one stable state to another              	|             	 					                           	|
| Resistance Stability						| Resistance is a metric that quantifies the change of a system after a perturbation. The smaller the change of the system after the perturbation, the more resistant the system.         	|             	               	                           	|

## Chapter 2 - Primer on Dynamical Systems

> In nature, when we study a complex system, it is almost always immediately essential that we reduce the dimensions of the problem to something tractable. When we can do this with limited loss of information, we have made considerable progress. At a level, this is the job of a scientist: to tell a mostly true story of a complex natural system using the barest essentials or fewest dimensions.
