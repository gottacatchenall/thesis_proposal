# From Populations to Ecosystems: Theoretical Foundations for a New Ecological Synthesis (Loreau 2011)

## Preface: On Unifying Approaches in Ecology

### Three different approaches to unifying theories in ecology:

1. Those that seek generalizations across hierarchical levels of organization based on physical/biochemical constraints
	- Metabolic theory: Energy/thermodynamics (Peters 1983; Brown et al. 2004)
	- Ecological Stoichiometry: materials/biochemistry 
	- Structure/topology
	- Dynamics
2. Those that simplify previously unrelated properties within a hierachical level
	- e.g. Hubbell's neutral theory, simplifies description of communities, thereby obtains simultaneous predictions for property's previuso described by different models
3. Those that merge perspectives/perspectives from different disciplines 
	- this is what this book tries to do

## Chapter One: Population and Ecosystem Approaches in Ecology

This chapter: brief review of population->community->ecosystem ecology

### Formalism of Population Dynamics

- Atomic unit is the individual of a given species in a population.
- **BIDE contraint**: all dynamics must obey the balance equation $N(t) = N(t-1) + B + I - D - E$.

#### Density-dependence and logistic growth

- Formally, a system ystem exhibits density dependence as $\frac{1}{N} \frac{dN}{dt} = f(N)$, where $f'(N) < 0$.
- First-order approximation of any density-dependent dynamics gives logistic growth
- Implicit assumtions lead to qualitatively different behavior: osciallatoins, chaos, etc. (Case 2000 review)
- Issue of $K$  -> amalgamation of many different factors that vary 


### Formalism of Ecosystem functioning

- Largely done through compartmental modeling with explicit contraints on mass/energy fluxes
- DeAngelis (1992), compartmental model generally of the form $$\frac{d\mathbf{X}}{dt} = \mathbf{F}\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{I}$$
- Simple flux models can be shown to have fixed point stability (all eigenvalues real and negative)


### Mass and Energy Budgets as a basis for unifying population and ecosystem approaches

- Generic physiological constriants can enable bettwer prediction 
	- Metabolic ecology (Brown et al 2004)
	- Ecological stochiometry (N, C, P fluxes; Sterner and Elser 2002)
